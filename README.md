## BUNKER-21

What is the game about?
PCB is a survival game set in the near future, in a post-apocalyptic world. Strange dreams lead you, the protagonist, to an underground bunker where you survived the global holocaust that decimated most of the world’s population. 5 years after the event, someone shows up at the bunker and it’s up to you to open the door or not, but with dwindling resources… is it really a choice?
You’ll have to manage supplies and make sure there’s enough water and food to see another day. When a stranger arrives, they may or may not share what they carry, or they might be looking to make the bunker their home without you in it.
